## Abstract:
The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) was developed to approximate solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. It employs a unitary transformation to prepare a quantum state encoding the problem's answer. The unitary parameters are optimized via a classical optimizer. In this study, we evaluate QAOA's performance on the NP-hard Travelling Salesman Problem and compare it to two variations: Warm-Start QAOA and QAOA+. The Travelling Salesperson Problem finds the shortest route between cities and their distances. It can be cast as a quantum problem solvable in Qiskit and other software using QAOA. Warm-Start QAOA initializes parameters based on a simplified problem solution, differing from standard initialization. QAOA+ extends the QAOA p=1 layer with an extra problem-independent layer to enhance approximation ratios and reduce circuit complexity compared to p=2 QAOA. Our analysis of the results sheds light on these QAOA variations' strengths and weaknesses in solving the Travelling Salesman Problem. We aim to provide insights while maintaining the original content's length and information.
